1.	We A/B tested two styles for a sign-up button on our company's product page. 100 visitors viewed page A, out of which 20 clicked on the button; whereas, 70 visitors viewed page B, and only 15 of them clicked on the button. Can you confidently say that page A is a better choice, or page B? Why?

	The only way to determine the better button would be to check how many clicks A had when its site was at 70 visitors, or wait to conduct the test once the site has had a total of 100 visitors while B was present. If the determination was made using only the click percentages B would the clear choice since it has a 2% higher click percentage than A (22% v. 20), but again this is based on differening base numerical values for each test. 
	For example, the next 30 people that visit the site while B is present may not click the button at all, and now A is the clear choice since it has a 5% higher click rate than B (20% v 15%). A better solution would be to have longer running tests for both buttons since such small sample sizes can often lead to vague, incorrect, or inconsistent conclusions.
